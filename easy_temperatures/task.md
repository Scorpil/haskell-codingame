In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data.

###INPUT:
**Line 1:** N, the number of temperatures to analyse  
**Line 2:** The N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526  

###OUTPUT:
Display 0 (zero) if no temperature is provided  
Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0, knowing that if two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 to 5, then display 5)

###CONSTRAINTS:
0 â‰¤ N < 10000

###EXAMPLE:

    Input             Output
    5                 1
    1 -2 -8 4 5

**Available RAM:** 512MB  
**Timeout:** 1 seconds
